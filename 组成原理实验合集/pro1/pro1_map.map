WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   XLXI_1/S[3]_PWR_11_o_Mux_72_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not
   good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the
   flip-flop.

  Nummber of MUXCYs used:                        0 out of  13,644    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           52
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            47 out of      52   90%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      52    0%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               3 out of  54,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
